-------------------------------------
There are three primary components in the project file: main.py, DES Algorithm.py, and AES Algorithm.py.
main.py contains the menu, from which you can start and run the program.

The DES Algorithm.py file has two functions: encrypt file and decrypt file, both of which use the DES Algorithm 64-bits.

The AES Algorithm.py file contains two functions: encrypt file and decrypt file, both of which use the 192-bit AES Algorithm.

All four functions accept two arguments (Key, File name)
